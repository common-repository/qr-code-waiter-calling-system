== Description ==

This plugin will help restaurants to reduce visits to the tables that will help to recude unnecessary contacts and keep social distancing.
Additionally it improves turnaround time by allowing restaurant clients to call a waiter with help of their smart phones via mobile web page. Client does not need to install any application. 

By installing this plugin, you will have a specially designed mobile page on your web site. 
This new page accepts Table number as a parameter. 
You will need to create **QR codes** and stick them to table or install them in a different way. 
Restaurant clients will scan these codes and will access this mobile page. 

On that page, there are three options:

* call waiter
* request for menu
* pay a bill

Once client selects one of the option, you will see it on your Smart phone or on a any Table PC you have.
